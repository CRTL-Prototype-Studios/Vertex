# CRTL Vertex

This is an Open-Source Markdown Editor Studio made by CRTL Prototype Studios. It is completely free and Open-Source with an MIT License.

_This project is dedicated to the hardworking Open-Source Community._

I originally wanted to make a Nuxt Module similar to Nuxt Studio's Visual Markdown Editor, which I had tried and thought was terrible.
Therefore, I started out researching stuff that can make something like this happen, and then I realized: how about a "Macrohard Words Online" (If you know what I mean by that ;) )
alternative for Markdown?

So I researched, tried my abilities, tried UI libraries, tried editor libraries in my former projects (They're all open-sourced as well).... and everything had led to this.

**CRTL Vertex**.
